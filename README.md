# Medical Cost Dataset Analysis  

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to analyze a medical cost dataset, uncover key patterns through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and build a predictive machine learning model to estimate medical costs based on patient information.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains patient data with features such as:  
- **Age**: Patient's age in years.  
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.  
- **Children**: Number of dependents.  
- **Smoker**: Smoking status (Yes/No).  
- **Region**: Patient's residential area in the US.  
- **Charges**: Medical insurance costs (target variable).  

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent values.  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., `smoker`, `region`).  
   - Scale numerical features (e.g., `age`, `BMI`).  

2. **EDA**:  
   - Visualize relationships between features and charges.  
   - Identify patterns (e.g., higher charges for smokers).  

3. **Feature Selection**:  
   - Evaluate feature importance for predicting charges.  

4. **Model Building**:  
   - Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).  
   - Evaluate models using metrics like RÂ² and RMSE.  

5. **Result Analysis**:  
   - Report model performance and insights derived.  

## Libraries Used  
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **numpy**: Numerical computations.  
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization.  
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning model building and evaluation.
